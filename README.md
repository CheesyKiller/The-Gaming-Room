# The-Gaming-Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, requested an application named Draw it or Lose it for android systmes. The application is a team game loosely similar to the 1980s television show Win, Lost, or Draw.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The functions in the objects had implied documentation, this is due to the function only having one purpose that aligns with the functions name.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Considering the hardware limitattion was a new insight onto my workflow, at my current job we do everything through the cloud so that was never taken into account.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I'd like to better organize the singleton tester, as I feel the structure of my project isn't accurate to a production environment.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Companies take user input on issues as a driving force for iterating their software, naming and structure were the priorities as without either the user may not be able to properly access the system.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Prior to this I had limited experience with singletons and learning more about implimenting and abstracting them was extreamly helpful. I'd use singletons and restricted constructors in the future to mitigate the instances of objects in memory.
